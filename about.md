Food plays an important part in our lives, as a way to celebrate happy occasions and mourn losses. It is natural (but may not be the most obvious) that the history of food is intertwined with the world history of war, religion, and politics.

This is a collection of easy to digest, bite sized food history. Hopefully you will learn something new about the past by tracing the origin of a food.

Bon app√©tit!
