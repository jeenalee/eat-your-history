The other day, I decided to learn more about flour tortilla, because I love flour tortilla! And I came across a very interesting sentence on Wikipedia page for flour tortilla: "...the wheat flour tortilla was an innovation by exiled Spanish Jews who did not consider corn meal to be kosher, using wheat brought from Europe, while this region was the colony of New Spain." Flour tortilla is typically made with *unleavened* wheat dough.

Interesting! I was curious about two things, 1) why were the Jews exiled from Spain, and 2) why was corn meal not considered kosher?

Jews in Spain, many of whom are Sephardic Jews, have suffered much discrimination throughout European history. Actually, Jews in general have gone through so much hatred in general, but the years that are potentially relevant to the invention of flour tortilla would be 1391 and 1492.

In 1391, there were many massacres athat took place in Spain. They all seem to have started by a single cleric named Ferrand Martinez who took the opportunity when an 11-year old boy (Henry III)became the King of Seville, and the country was going through a rough patch. He started encouraging violent acts agains Jews, which resulted in thousands of murders. The remaining Jews were forced to convert to baptism, which gave birth to the word *converso*.

Spain becomes even more Catholic with the Catholic Monarchs that united Aragon and Castille of Spain in 1469. 22 years after the Catholic Monarchs came to power, they started Alhambra Decree, which forced thousands of Spanish Jew to either convert to Catholicism, or get expelled. Many Spanish Jews fled to Mexico, which was part of Spanish colony at the time. Maybe Alhambra Decree helped the Catholic Monarchs earn the title "Most Catholic Majesty" by Pope Alexander VI in 1493, but I digress...

So the wikipedia pages states that exiled Spanish Jews did not consider corn meal to be kosher, but it turns out nothing is not-kosher about corn. Corn tortilla is traditionally made with corn meal and water, and therefore it should be kosher naturally. The only way corn tortilla could be considered not okay would be during Passover in Ashkenazi culture. During Passover, eating *chametz* which are leavened grain based food (wheat, spelt, barley, oats, rye) are prohibited. Ashkenazi laws go a step further and prohibits *kitniyot* which are various legumes, grains, and seeds, including corn. However, Sephardi Jews **does not** adopt this law, and so corn is allowed during Passover as well!

It seems like there is a lot of debate on whether flour tortilla is actually invented by the exiled Spanish Jews. Nonetheless, I learned a lot about history and kosher laws, and hopefully you found it interesting too.
