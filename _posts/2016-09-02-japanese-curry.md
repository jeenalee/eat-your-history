Japanese curry (or *kare*) is different from Indian curry -- it's much
smoother in taste, almost like brown gravy that is a little bit
spicy. It is usually made by making roux, and adding some curry powder
and maybe vegetables or meat pieces. Due to its popularity, there are
many options of pre-made curry roux blocks so that you can make the
meal quickly. The question is, how did curry powder get to Japan?

English embassadors introduced curry to Japan during the Meiji era,
which began in 1868. What were the English embassadors doing in Japan
in the 19th century? During the Meiji era, Japan actively communicated
with foreign countries, especially from the Western hemisphere, after
Sakoku policy ended with the birth of the Meiji era.

Sakoku ("Closed country") policy prohibited Japan from interacting
with the world outside of Japan. There were a few Sakoku policies, and
the one that sparked the birth of kare would be the third one in
Japanese history, which happens to be the longest one as well. This
Sakoku policy started in 1635 and lasted until 1866. Japan decreed
Sakoku Policy because they were worried that outside influence would
weaken the empire. So the emperor decided to seclude the country from
the rest of the world. I especially find it ineresting that one of the
key points to Sakoku was a strict ban on Catholicism. Sakoku policy
lasted for almost 200 years until it was forcibly ended by the United
States of America in 1866.

Once Japan opened its gates to foreign countries, the empire quickly
realized that Japan was no longer a safe island that was protected by
the sea. Japan decideded that in order to avoid colonization by other
countries (at that time, imperialism was quite a popular idea in the
West), they must learn about imperialism as much as they could. This
was so important that when the Meiji government defined their top five
goals, learning about imperialism appeared as one of them.

At the time, England was occupying India. Japan took notice and
invited the English over to share their knowledge. The English
ambassadors brought curry powder with them, and that's how Japan first
got to taste curry, and eventually created kare.
