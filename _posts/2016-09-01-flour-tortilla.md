The other day, I decided to learn more about flour tortilla, because I love flour tortilla! And I came across a very interesting sentence on Wikipedia page for flour tortilla:
>...the wheat flour tortilla was an innovation by exiled Spanish Jews who did not consider corn meal to be kosher, using wheat brought from Europe, while this region was the colony of New Spain."
