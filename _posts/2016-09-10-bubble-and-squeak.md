When I was visiting London, I walked around the city near brunch time
and saw that a lot of restaurants were serving "bubble and squeak". I
had never seen or heard of that dish before, but the name was so funny
that it stuck in my head.

Bubble and squeak has many variations, but most variations contain
cabbage. The cabbage, while cooking, makes a bubbly and squeaky noise,
and this is how the dish got its humorous name. Despite its funny
name, bubble and squeak has a sad history.

During World War II, food was so scarce in England that the government
controlled the food consumption through a ration system. Each person
had a ration card that listed personal information like age and
pregnancy. With the ration system, people had a limit on how much food
they could buy. Some kinds of food, like certain fruits, were so rare
that they became completely unavailable during WW2. Bananas, for
example, did not exist in England for a decade or so, and the children
who grew up during this era did not believe such fruit existed.

In an attempt to stretch their rations, Londonites cooked their
leftovers with cabbages and other vegetables the next day. Bubble and
squeak existed prior to World War 2, but the ration system during the
war popularized the dish.

While researching for this blog post, I found a fantastic blog that
features wartime recipes, in which the author re-creates recipes that
were appropriate for the ration system in the 1940s. While people kept
gardens for vegetables, a weekly ration for **one** adult was:

>
• Bacon & Ham: 4 oz<br>
• Fresh meat: to the value of 1 shilling and sixpence (around 1/2 lb minced beef)<br>
• Butter: 2 oz<br>
• Cheese: 2 oz<br>
• Margarine: 4 oz<br>
• Cooking fat: 4 oz<br>
• Milk: 3 pints<br>
• Sugar: 8 oz<br>
• Tea: 2 oz<br>
• Eggs: 1 fresh egg **per week**<br>
• Sweets/Candy: 12 oz **per 4 weeks**<br>
• Preserves: 1 lb **per 2 months**<br>
